# Chess - Salesforce Apex and Visualforce Implementation

This project is a Salesforce-based Chess game developed using **Apex**, **Visualforce Pages**, and **JavaScript**. It includes core chess functionalities such as rendering chess pieces, validating moves, and keeping track of game states, all within the Salesforce platform. The app leverages Salesforce's robust capabilities to create an interactive chessboard while allowing communication between different components through Visualforce remoting and Apex classes.

## Features

- **Full Chess Gameplay**: Implements all standard chess rules and piece movements.
- **Dynamic Chessboard Rendering**: The chessboard dynamically renders using Visualforce and JavaScript, providing an interactive UI for players.
- **Move Validation**: Validates the legality of moves in real-time, ensuring players adhere to chess rules.
- **Game State Sharing**: Allows sharing the game state using FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) and sending it to other systems via WebSockets.
- **Apex and SOQL Integration**: Uses Salesforce's server-side logic for handling chess data, SOQL for querying records, and efficient data management.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with user experience in mind, featuring smooth transitions and responsive design.
